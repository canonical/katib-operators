  Katib supports Hyperparameter Tuning, Early Stopping and Neural Architecture Search

  Katib is the project which is agnostic to machine learning (ML) frameworks. It can tune
  hyperparameters of applications written in any language of the users’ choice and natively
  supports many ML frameworks, such as TensorFlow, MXNet, PyTorch, XGBoost, and others.
